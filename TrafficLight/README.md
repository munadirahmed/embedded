  <p align="justify">
    The Traffic Light System project implements a standard traffic light sequence using the Tiva C Launchpad. This project aims to demonstrate basic embedded system concepts, including timing, state machines, and GPIO control. It serves as an educational tool for understanding how microcontrollers can be used to control hardware components like LEDs in a real-world application. The system cycles through red, yellow, and green lights, mimicking the operation of a real traffic signal.

<!-- System Design -->
## System Design

<div align="center">
<a >
    <img src="images/trafficLight_stateMachinev100.png" alt="Traffic Light State Machine">
</a>
</div>

This state machine diagram represents the operation of a traffic light control system, managing the signal flow for two intersecting roads, referred to as the "Primary Road" and "Secondary Road." The system transitions through various states to control the timing of traffic signals. Below is an explanation of each state and the transitions:

1. **Initialize:**
   - This is the starting state where the system initializes. The transition from this state occurs when the initialization timer (`T_st > T_init`) completes.
   - In the `Initialize` state, the `roadForNextGrnLight` parameter is set to designate the primary road as the next to receive a green light.

2. **Both Roads Red:**
   - After initialization, the system enters a state where both roads display a red light. This state is a buffer period to ensure both roads stop before allowing any road to go green.
   - The system remains in this state until a timer (`T_st > T1`) triggers the next transition.

3. **Decision Node - `roadForNextGrnLight?`:**
   - The system checks which road should receive the green light next.
   - If the primary road is selected (`T_st > T2`), it transitions to the "Primary Road Green" state.
   - If the secondary road is selected (`T_st > T3`), it transitions to the "Secondary Road Green" state.

4. **Primary Road Green:**
   - In this state, the primary road displays a green light, allowing traffic to flow.
   - After the green light timer (`T_st > T4`) expires, the system transitions to "Primary Road Yellow."
   - Upon entering the `Primary Road Green` state, the `roadForNextGrnLight` parameter is set to designate the secondary road as the next to receive a green light.

5. **Primary Road Yellow:**
   - The primary road's light changes to yellow, warning that the signal will soon turn red.
   - Once the yellow light timer (`T_st > T6`) expires, the system returns to the "Both Roads Red" state.

6. **Secondary Road Green:**
   - Here, the secondary road receives a green light, permitting traffic to flow.
   - After the green light timer (`T_st > T5`) ends, the system moves to "Secondary Road Yellow."
   - Upon entering the `Secondary Road Green` state, the `roadForNextGrnLight` parameter is set to designate the primary road as the next to receive a green light.

7. **Secondary Road Yellow:**
   - The secondary road's light switches to yellow, signaling the end of the green light period.
   - Once the yellow light timer (`T_st > T7`) completes, the system transitions back to the "Both Roads Red" state.

### Flow Summary:
- The system cycles through these states, alternating between allowing the primary and secondary roads to move.
- Timers are used to control the duration of each state.
- After each yellow light, the system ensures both roads are red before allowing the next green light.

This state machine ensures a safe and orderly flow of traffic at the intersection by systematically controlling the timing of the traffic lights for both roads.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
