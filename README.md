# Embedded Systems Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Embedded Systems Projects Repository**! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of various embedded systems projects, demonstrating a range of microcontroller architectures, development environments, and programming techniques. Each project is designed to showcase specific functionalities, from simple GPIO control to complex real-time systems, and is documented to provide insights into its design and implementation.

## Introduction

This repository is a curated collection of embedded systems projects that I have worked on, using a variety of microcontrollers, sensors, and communication protocols. The projects are designed to address real-world problems and are a great resource for learning and experimentation in embedded systems development.

Each project folder contains the source code, schematics, and detailed documentation to help you understand the design and implementation process.

## Projects

### Traffic Light Control System

- **Description:** A state machine-based traffic light control system implemented on the Tiva C Launchpad. The system controls the traffic flow at an intersection, using timed transitions between states for the primary and secondary roads.
- **Technologies:** Tiva C Launchpad, Code Composer Studio 12.7.1, GNU Compiler v9.2.1, Quantum Leaps startup code, CMSIS v5.0.1.
- **Highlights:** Robust state machine design, efficient use of timers, CMSIS integration.

## Tools & Environments

This repository leverages various tools and environments tailored to the specific needs of each project. Below are some of the key tools used:

- **Code Composer Studio (CCS) 12.7.1**: For Tiva C Launchpad projects.
- **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)**: For compiling C/C++ code.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/embedded-projects-repo.git
