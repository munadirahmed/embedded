## Introduction

This repository is a curated collection of embedded systems projects that I have worked on, using a both MCUs and FPGAs. The projects are designed to address real-world problems and are a great resource for learning and experimentation in embedded systems development.

Each project folder contains the source code, schematics, and detailed documentation to help you understand the design and implementation process.

## Projects

### Traffic Light Control System

- **Description:** A state machine-based traffic light control system implemented on the Tiva C Launchpad. The system controls the traffic flow at an intersection, using timed transitions between states for the primary and secondary roads.
- [**Project Files**](/TrafficLight)

## Tools & Environments

This repository leverages various tools and environments tailored to the specific needs of each project. Below are some of the key tools used:

- **Code Composer Studio (CCS) 12.7.1**: For Tiva C Launchpad projects.
- **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)**: For compiling C/C++ code.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/munadirahmed/embedded
